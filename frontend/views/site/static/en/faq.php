<p>Posting a job is free and easy. You’ll need a PayPal account (you will only be charged once you agree to hire someone). First sign up and create your profile, then in the main page, under “Find Help” click “create a task”. You will be redirected to a prompt in which you will fill in your job’s necessary specifications. You can set your terms and price and, once you find a helper and agree to each other’s terms, you will be prompted to make a payment which will be held by Helping Hut and awarded to the helper once the task is confirmed to be finished.</p>
